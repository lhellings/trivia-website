  <h1>About the author:</h1>
  <p>My name is Laura and I'm currently a student at North Lake College. I have been wanting to make a website on <br>
  trivia for a while. I, personally, am terrible at trivia and have actively avoided it most of my life.<br>
  However, over the years I have become a little fascinated with it because you can find a very simple question and find<br>
  a whole story or many stories connected with it and those connections can broaden your understanding of the world.<br>
  The questions by themselves seem meaningless, random, absurd...trivial--but having some background information around them<br>
  fleshes them out into something meaningful.</p>
  
  <p>For instance, knowing that the nickname for Wyoming is The Equality State is a bit trivial. Knowing that it got that<br>
  nickname because Wyoming was the first state to give women the right to vote is more meaningful. Knowing that this state<br>
  is pretty conservative, but has a very low population and might have granted women the vote to simply gain more voters<br>
  and not because the prevailing culture was necessarily progressive is even more meaningful. You can get some more info<br>
  here on a<a href ="https://www.realclearhistory.com/historiat/2018/07/09/brief_history_of_the_equality_state_333.html" target="_blank">
