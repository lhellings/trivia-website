   <p>In what city was the famous coffeehouse chain Starbucks founded?</p>
   <br>
   <p>
    The answer is Seattle. But next time you have a craving for deep roast coffee, I hope you think of the deep blue sea. Maybe even curling up with<br>
    an interseting book. Do you think of the sea when you go to Starbucks? Probably not, but you will after reading this.
    <br><br>
    <br>Starbucks was founded by an English teacher, a history teacher, and a writer. The name comes from Starbuck, a chief mate in the book Moby Dick, 
    <br>one of the most famous novels based on life on the sea. Their other choice for a name was Pequod, the name of the whaling ship in Moby Dick.
    <br>The connection with the sea doesn't end there. Have you ever noticed what the logo is? It's a two-tailed mermaid or siren who is supposed to
    <br>based on the mythical character Melusine, a woman with many versions of back stories associated with the water. The logo used to be a little
    <br>obvious and obviously topless. However as the company grew and it got more pressure to stylize the logo into a more family-friendly stylized graphic.
