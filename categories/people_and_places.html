  <p class = "pp">Who did Christina Onassis grudgingly give $25 million to, in 1977?</p>
  <p>The answer is Jacqueline Kennedy, or Jacqueline Onassis at the time of the settlement.<br>
   The back story behind this question has a lot of information about powerful and intriguing families and
   some interesting life lessons as well. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Jacqueline Kennedy
   married business magnate Aristotle Onassis. Aristotle Onassis was a shipping magnate who owned one
   of the world's largest privately owned shipping fleet. He was one of the world's wealthiest and
   famous men in the world. Despite his enormous success, his in-laws from his first wife despised him
   because he was not considered "old" money within the Greek heritage that his in-laws felt that their
   daughter should be married to. His legacy and his relation to his in-laws shows that to some people
   you will never be good enough regardless what you accomplish. Unsurprisingly, his in-laws caused
   serious marital problems with his first wife, with whom he had his children, Christina and Alexander.
   Onassis. Christina had four marriages, all ending in divorce, before she passed away at the
   very young age of thirty-seven from a heart-attack. At the age of thirty she was diagnosed with 
   depression and prescribed barbituates, amphetamines, and sleeping pills. Christina Onassis was
   a stunning example of how wealth does not always buy happiness. She gave Jacqueline Onassis
   $25 million dollars as an agreement that Jacqueline would not contest the will of Aristotle Onassis
   when he passed away.

   <p class = "pp">In what city was the famous coffeehouse chain Starbucks founded?</p>
   <p>
    The answer is Seattle. But next time you have a craving for deep roast coffee, I hope you think of the deep blue sea. Maybe even curling up with
    an interseting book. Do you think of the sea when you go to Starbucks? Probably not, but you will after reading this.
    Starbucks was founded by an English teacher, a history teacher, and a writer. The name comes from Starbuck, a chief mate in the book Moby Dick, 
    one of the most famous novels based on life on the sea. Their other choice for a name was Pequod, the name of the whaling ship in Moby Dick.
    The connection with the sea doesn't end there. Have you ever noticed what the logo is? It's a two-tailed mermaid or siren who is supposed to
    be based on the mythical character Melusine, a woman with many versions of back stories associated with the water. The logo used to be a little
    more obvious and obviously topless. However, as the company grew and it got more pressure to stylize the logo into a more family-friendly stylized graphic.
