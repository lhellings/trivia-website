   <p>What year did Cal Ripken Jr. begin his record consecutive-game streak?</p>
   <br>
   <p>The anwser is 1982. This particular question led to a lot of interesting back story research, so let's dig in!
   <br>Cal Ripken Jr. holds the records for the most consecutive games played with 2,632 games played in a row.
   <br>What's just as interesting is who he beat and some other patterns in baseball statistics.
   <br>The record he beat was Lou Gherig who suffered the disease name after his namesake Lou Gherig's disease.
   <br>Despite his disease, he not only did he set the consecutive-game record that took 56 years to beat, but he
   <br>also was the first person in the 20th century to hit four homeruns in a single game. Of the all
   <br>the years of baseball statistics, only 18 players have made that accomplishment and no one has hit more
   <br>than four homeruns in single game. Lou Gherig died at the relatively young age of 37 and was an incredible
   <br>athlete. 
   <br>You may not have heard much about him because most of his career was overshaowed by Babe Buth. And while
   <br>Babe Ruth's homerun record may have been beaten several times over, he still holds the record for hitting
   <br>the most homeruns in a single postseason game, that is three homeruns in a single postseason game.
