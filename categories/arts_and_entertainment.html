   <p class = "ae">What literary trilogy kept Dante Alighieri busy in the early 14th century?</p>  
   <p>The answer is The Divine Comedy. It is an imaginative long narrative poem illustrating the afterlife as developed by the Western Church. 
   The trilogy is broken into Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. The journey begins the night before Good Friday and ends Wednesday 
   after Easter in the year 1300. 
   In Dante's time, it was the norm to publish serious topics in Latin. But he wrote it in the common Italian. Translated in English, 
   one of the most famous lines is "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here." Every time you hear a refernce to a circle of hell,
   that is a direct reference to Dante's organization of hell. In the Divine Comedy, there are nine circles of hell and satan
   is the finishing touch in the center.</p>
