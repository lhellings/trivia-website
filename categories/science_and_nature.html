   <p>What did Armand Fizeau measure in 1849?</p>
   <p>The speed of light. He got within 5% of the correct value. His studied dispelled the idea of aether
   and were crucial in Einstein's developing special relativity. Fizeau also predicted the redshifting 
   of electromagnetic waves and helped discover the Doppler effect.</p>

   <p class = "sn">What barnyard animal is three times as populous as humans?</p>
   <p>The answer is the chicken. About every 15 years since the 1960s, we've been able to double the production of chicken growth.
   An extra bonus about chickens is that they are tetrachromatic- that means they can see ultraviolet. They have receptors cones 
   for red, green, blue, and ultraviolet.
