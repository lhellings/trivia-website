   <p>What barnyard animal is three times as populous as humans?</p>
   <br>
   <p>The answer is the chicken. About every 15 years since the 1960s, we've been able to double the production of chicken growth.
   <br>An extra bonus about chickens is that they are tetrachromatic- that means they can see ultraviolet. They have receptors cones 
   <br>for red, green, blue, and ultraviolet.
