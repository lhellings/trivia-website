   <p>What Mattel doll in a wheelchair is unable to fit through the front door of the Barbie Dream House?</p>
   <br>
   <p>The answer is Share a Smile Becky. Some sources the doll came out in 1996 and others in 1997. Either way,
   <br>the doll was not out for very long before being discontinued. Since Share a Smile Becky, Mattel has not
   <br>featured another doll with disabilities. To me it seems like a great way to build a whole new product line
   <br>around a whole new Mattel character.
