   <p>What communist country closed its schools and universities from 1966 to 1968?</p>
   <br>
   <p>The answer is China. The sociopolitical movement known as the Cultural Revolution was launched by Mao Zedong and carried outline
   <br>by the Red Guards. The aim of the Cultural Revolution was to destroy what was called the "Four Olds": old customs, old culture,
   <br>old habits, and old ideas. Part of that destruction was the government support of the Red Guards to vandalize and destroy
   <br>most public property such as temples, schools, cemeteries, libraries and anything else that was deemed from or supportive of
   <br>the "four olds". The Red Guards had unlimited legal ability to humiliate, confiscate personal property, torture, execute, 
   <br>imprison, and force into hard labor any citizen who was deemed to be supportive of the four olds. In place of the four olds,
   <br>was the praise and the cult of personality of Mao Zedong. The Cultural Revolution began in 1966 and ended when Mao Zedong
   <br>died in 1976.
