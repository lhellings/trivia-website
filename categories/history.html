  <p class = "h">Why did Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, want to have Salman Rushdie murdered?</p>
  <p>For writing the fictional novel The Satanic Verses. The Satanic Verses was published in 1988 and it outraged
  the Muslim world. Ayatollah promised money to whoever killed Rushdie and heaven to whoever died in the process
  of killing Rushdie. The book was banned in India as hate speech. Rushdie had to be put under police protection.
  While Rushdie escaped physical harm, many in connection with his book were killed or injured. His Japanese 
  translator was stabbed to death. His Italian translator was stabbed and survived. His Norwegian publisher
  was shot three times and lived. Rushdie was knighted for his literature by the Queen of England in 2007.

   <p class = "h">What Russian republic was named "Yeltsin's Vietnam" in 1995?</p>
   <p>The answer is Chechnya. Like the United States in Vietnam, Russia had greater manpower, artillery, weapon systems, and combat support
   but Russia was demoralized and crumbled under Chechnya's guerilla warfare just as the United States fighting the Vietnam War.
   To make matters worse, many of the Russian soldiers were untrained and uncertain in their orders causing them to attack and
   kill an enormous amount of civilians. The Storming of Grozny was such a humanitarian crisis that it was globally criticized.
   Boris Yeltsin declared a ceasefire in 1996.

   <p class = "h">What communist country closed its schools and universities from 1966 to 1968?</p>
   <p>The answer is China. The sociopolitical movement known as the Cultural Revolution was launched by Mao Zedong and carried out
   by the Red Guards. The aim of the Cultural Revolution was to destroy what was called the "Four Olds": old customs, old culture,
   old habits, and old ideas. Part of that destruction was the government support of the Red Guards to vandalize and destroy
   most public property such as temples, schools, cemeteries, libraries and anything else that was deemed from or supportive of
   the "four olds". The Red Guards had unlimited legal ability to humiliate, confiscate personal property, torture, execute, 
   imprison, and force into hard labor any citizen who was deemed to be supportive of the four olds. In place of the four olds,
   was the praise and the cult of personality of Mao Zedong. The Cultural Revolution began in 1966 and ended when Mao Zedong
   died in 1976.
