  <h2>Trivia and Interesting Stories</h2>
   <p class = "info">Have you ever heard a trivia question and ever thought what is that even referring to?
    Or maybe thought it was so oddly specific that there had to be more behind that question?
    I have always found the trivial nature of trivia odd and I have never been drawn to
    collecting a bunch of seemingly unrelated facts. However, in my search for greater <em>understanding</em>
    of the nature of knowledge, facts are connected to each other often in unexpected and surprising ways.
	I have always been drawn to drawing connections to facts and I want to use this platform to do that.	  	
   </p>   
   
  <h3>Categories</h3>
   <p>I'm going to base my categories exactly like the Trivial Pursuit board game <cite>www.hasbro.com</cite><br>
   Trivial Pursuit has six categories:</p>
   <p>
    <ul id = "list">
      <li id = "pp">People and Places</li>
	  <li id = "ae">Arts and Entertainment</li>
	  <li id = "h">History</li>
	  <li id = "sn">Science and Nature</li>
	  <li id = "sl">Sports and Leisure</li>
	  <li id = "wc">Wild Card</li>
     </ul>
	</p>
	
	<article id = "intronote">
	I think it would be rather dull to give trivial information outright. So I would like to give <br>
	a piece of trivial information and give some back up story or extra information from it.<br>
	<br>
	For a long time, I have avoided trivia becauses as its definition implies, it is unimportant.
	However, I read this about the idea of a body of knowledge:<br>
	 <blockquote>
	  But whether trivia questions are unimportant <em>per se</em> is open to considerable discussion
	  and here the answer -or, more precisely, the answers- are far from simple. Among the many
	  characterstics that go into defining intelligence is the ability to manipulate facts. It refers
	  to the ability to examine a quantity of information and arrange the elements in such a way as to
	  arrive at a conclusion, a decision, or a solution. It's called intuition. Intuition is the
	  accumulation of millions- perhaps even billions or trillions- of tiny, "trivial" bits of information
	  that are stored in the recesses of our memories.
