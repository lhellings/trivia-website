	 <p class = "wc">What Asian nation's cremation rate is a record 99 percent?</p>
	 <p>The answer is Japan. The tradition is so important and strongly embedded in the Japanese
	 culture that even when it was banned by the Meiji government it was only banned for two years
	 and even then wood was burned as part of the funeral to act as a replacement for the cremation.
	 Cremation has its origin in Buddha's instruction to be cremated and in the monks desire to 
	 emulate him. Today, cremation is mandatory in most municipalities of Japan. </p>

   <p class = "wc">What Mattel doll in a wheelchair is unable to fit through the front door of the Barbie Dream House?</p>
   <p>The answer is Share a Smile Becky. Some sources the doll came out in 1996 and others in 1997. Either way,
   the doll was not out for very long before being discontinued. Since Share a Smile Becky, Mattel has not
   featured another doll with disabilities. To me it seems like a great way to build a whole new product line
   around a whole new Mattel character.
