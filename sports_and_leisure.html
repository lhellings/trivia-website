	<p class = "sl">What golfing feat did the sportswriter Grantland Rice dub "the impregnable quadrilateral"?</p>
	<p>The answer is The Grand Slam. The Grand Slam of Golf requires one player winning all four
	major annual tournaments. Thus the four-sided or quadrilateral nearly impossible challenge.
	Other sports have Grand Slams too. In tennis, it is one player winning all four major annual 
	tournaments. The Grand Slam of Nascar is winning all Sprint Cup Series majors in a calendar year.
	The Grand Slam of baseball is a homerun with all four bases occupied. The Grand Slam of Ultrarunning
	is for a person to finish four annual 100-mile footraces in the U.S. The term grand slam comes from 
	bridge which means to win all thirteen tricks in the game.</p>

   <p class = "sl">What nation won a record 195 medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics?</p>
   <p>The answer is The Soviet Union. The 1980 Summer Olympics was surrounded in quite
   a lot of controversy in internationl politics and within the Olympic Games itself.
   The games were held in Moscow. This was the first Olympic Games to be held in a 
   Slavic-language speaking country. It also had a very small representation of 
   countries competing because 66 countries boycotted the games because of the 
   Soviet- Afghan War.
   <br>
   Controversy within the games themselves had to do with performance-enhancing
   drugs. A 1989 report from the Australian Senate made a statement that the 
   Moscow Games might well have been called the Chemists' Games.   
   Investigations in the 1980 Olympic Games led to a new technique for measuring 
   abnormally high levels of testosterone in urine. The first documented case of 
   "blood doping" occurred where a runner was transfused with blood to increase
   red blood cells and thus aerobic capacity.

   <p class = "sl">What year did Cal Ripken Jr. begin his record consecutive-game streak?</p>
   <p>The anwser is 1982. This particular question led to a lot of interesting back story research, so let's dig in!
   Cal Ripken Jr. holds the records for the most consecutive games played with 2,632 games played in a row.
   What's just as interesting is who he beat and some other patterns in baseball statistics.
   The record he beat was Lou Gherig who suffered the disease name after his namesake Lou Gherig's disease.
   Despite his disease, he not only set the consecutive-game record that took 56 years to beat, but he
   also was the first person in the 20th century to hit four homeruns in a single game. Of the all
   the years of baseball statistics, only 18 players have made that accomplishment and no one has hit more
   than four homeruns in single game. Lou Gherig died at the relatively young age of 37 and was an incredible
   athlete. 
   You may not have heard much about him because most of his career was overshaowed by Babe Buth. And while
   Babe Ruth's homerun record may have been beaten several times over, he still holds the record for hitting
   the most homeruns in a single postseason game, that is three homeruns in a single postseason game.
